# Spektr components library

Collection of ui primitives and utils for building <a href="https://novaspektr.io/" target="_blank">Nova Spektr</a> and related applications.

## How to import

Library is a combination of several sources:

* <Box direction='row' verticalAlign='center'>`Design System / kit` <Icon name="right" size={12} /> `@/shared/ui-kit`</Box>
* <Box direction='row' verticalAlign='center'>`Design System / entities` <Icon name="right" size={12} /> `@/shared/ui-entities`</Box>
* <Box direction='row' verticalAlign='center'>`v1 / kit` <Icon name="right" size={12} /> `@/shared/ui` <sup><small>deprecated</small></sup></Box>
* <Box direction='row' verticalAlign='center'>`v1 / entities` <Icon name="right" size={12} /> `@/entities/*` <sup><small>deprecated</small></sup></Box>

## Basic conceptions

### Separation

Components are segregated into two distinct branches, ensuring library modularity and preventing feature bloat.

#### kit: the basic building blocks

Components classified as `kit` represent foundational elements characterized by:

- Interaction with generic data types like text, numbers, dates, and lists;
- Generation of abstract user interactions outside of specific business context;
- Building of basic layout.

Illustrative examples:
- `Button` triggers a click without encoding specific workflow logic;
- `Select` picks value without knowing semantic meaning;
- `Input` edits some text;
- `Box` provides flexible layout scaffolding.

#### entities: domain-specific components

`entities` encapsulate components with specialized knowledge of the Polkadot ecosystem.

Illustrative examples:
- `Address` rendering hash with identicon;
- `Account` combining address with chain-specific explorer links;
- `AssetIcon` picking certain icon for given asset.

### Composition
Each component is engineered with a singular, focused responsibility.
Any variations in behavior and presentation are achieved through component composition rather than customization.

### Minimal API surface
Main goal is to make props of each component simple and memorable. It's achieved by some restrictions:
- No `className` prop;
- Almost no dom element props in component API (except for integration between components);
- Finite number of component states. In theory developer can write examples for all combinations of props.
